# SDEV193_Project

DESCRIPTION: Create a Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game using Python programming language.

INTRODUCTION:
Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard Spock is a two-person game and variation of the original Rock, Paper, Scissors game, where each item is trumped by another. The variation originates from the TV Series Big Bang Theory Season 2 Episode 8 "The Lizard-Spock Expansion". Our goal is to create a Python-based version of the game that is easy to play and fun for users.

FEATURES:

USER INTERACTION:
The game will have a command line interface that allows players to interact with the program.
Players will be able to type a one letter selection choice
Appropriate validation will be implemented to handle invalid inputs.

GAME LOGIC:
The program will incorporate the rules of the game where, As Sheldon explains, "Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors." (Lorre et al., 2008).
The computer opponent will randomly select a choice to compete against the user.
The program will determine the winner based on the selections made by both the user and the computer.

SCORE TRACKING:
The game will keep track of the user's score throughout multiple rounds.
After each round, the program will display the results and update the score accordingly.
At the end of the game, the final score will be displayed to the user.

ERROR HANDLING:
The program will provide appropriate error messages to the user to handle potential errors, such as invalid inputs.
Input validation will be implemented to ensure that the user's choice is limited to rock, paper, or scissors.

GIT INTEGRATION:
The project will be managed using Git.
Git commands, such as committing changes, branching, and merging, will be utilized throughout the development process.
The project's repository will be hosted on GitHub.

DOCUMENTATION:
The project will include a README file that describes the game, its rules, and how to run it.
Additional comments and docstrings will be added throughout the codebase to improve readability and understanding.

# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to the quick start guide for the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game project (SDEV193_Project)! In this project, we'll be creating a Python-based version of the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock" made famous by the TV Series "The Big Bang Theory." Players will compete against a computer opponent, and the game will keep track of their scores.

# Prerequisites
Python installed on your computer (version 3.x or higher).

# Getting Started
**Clone the repository**: Start by cloning the project's repository from GitHub to your local machine using the following command:


`git clone https://github.com/your-username/SDEV193_Project.git`

**Navigate to the project directory**: Change your working directory to the project's root folder:

`cd SDEV193_Project`

**Run the game**: Now you are ready to play the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game! To start the game, run the Python script:


`python game.py`

# How to Play
**Game Rules**: The game follows the rules outlined in "The Big Bang Theory" TV series. Here's a quick reminder of the rules:

Scissors cuts paper
Paper covers rock
Rock crushes lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes scissors
Scissors decapitates lizard
Lizard eats paper
Paper disproves Spock
Spock vaporizes rock
Rock crushes scissors

**User Interaction**: When prompted, type the letter corresponding to your choice:

'R' for Rock
'P' for Paper
'S' for Scissors
'L' for Lizard
'K' for Spock
**Score Tracking**: The game will keep track of your score as you play multiple rounds. After each round, the results will be displayed, showing who won that round. At the end of the game, the final score will be shown.

**Error Handling**: The program will handle invalid inputs gracefully, so don't worry if you mistype your choice.
