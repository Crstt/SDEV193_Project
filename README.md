# SDEV193_Project

DESCRIPTION: Create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game using Python programming language.

INTRODUCTION:
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a two-person game  where each item is trumped by another. Our goal is to create a Python-based version of the game that is easy to play and fun for users.

FEATURES:

USER INTERACTION:
The game will have a command line interface that allows players to interact with the program.
Players will be able to type rock, paper, or scissors through the command line.
Appropriate validation will be implemented to handle invalid inputs.

GAME LOGIC:
The program will incorporate the rules of the game, where rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.
The computer opponent will randomly select a choice to compete against the user.
The program will determine the winner based on the selections made by both the user and the computer.

The Alternate version of the Game is Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock. The Alternate version will function just like the original, with two additional outcomes possible.

SCORE TRACKING:
The game will keep track of the user's score throughout multiple rounds.
After each round, the program will display the results and update the score accordingly.
At the end of the game, the final score will be displayed to the user.

ERROR HANDLING:
The program will provide appropriate error messages to the user to handle potential errors, such as invalid inputs.
Input validation will be implemented to ensure that the user's choice is limited to rock, paper, or scissors.

GIT INTEGRATION:
The project will be managed using Git.
Git commands, such as committing changes, branching, and merging, will be utilized throughout the development process.
The project's repository will be hosted on GitHub.

DOCUMENTATION:
The project will include a README file that describes the game, its rules, and how to run it.
Additional comments and docstrings will be added throughout the codebase to improve readability and understanding.
